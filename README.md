## ** Introduction**
**Nuke script Teleporter** is a UI hotbox style application for Nuke that will allow users to quickly jump to specific areas of the script so artist can work faster and efficiently .
The idea is to setup important parts of any given Nuke script, like Characters, Props, Plates, Cameras. After doing this the artist would be able to quickly navigate to any of the mentioned areas of the script with only a couple of clicks. 

As part of the development roadmap there would be a bunch of features that I would like to add like:

- Implementation for Linux and other OS,  since the main development would be done in Windows. 
- Creation of custom Bookmarks. 
- Customization for specific projects, adding icons and images that represent an specific project, just to give it a bit of flavor.
